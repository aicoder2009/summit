The Summit is Hack Clubâ€™s first hackathon for club leaders around the world held in San Francisco from February 23th, 2024 (Friday, starting at noon) to February 25th (Sunday, ending at 6pm). 50 club leaders will come to the event and collaborate on projects that will make their clubs more magical. They will leave the event with a whole new set of tools built by other leaders at the event, many new friends, and a greater sense of ownership over the Hack Club community.

## What does it mean for a project to be magical?

### I cannot think of any ideas...
Here are some fun exercises to come up with ideas.

Also, here are some ideas to draw inspiration from:
* Spotify Wrapped is a pretty viral cultural phenmoneon these days. How might a similar concept exist in Hack Club?
* Drawing Orpheus is hard... what if there was an AI model for orpheus drawings?
* 

## How can I join?

## I have more questions...
